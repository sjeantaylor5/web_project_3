**About the Project**

This is an adaptive and responsive webpage about the travels from Portland, ME to Portland, OR. This webpage is constructed to take you on a journey from one city and state to another as you make your way to your destination. The best thing about this webpage is you can view it on any device and get the same journey. You'll get to see all kinds of breath taking pictures from the journey across different statelines. You will pass through many beautiful states such as, Maine, New York, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Ohio! This webpage also has interactive links that you can travel to to gather more information on the states, such as things to do and places to see while you are passing through. Don't forget to check out the Route 66 link towards the bottom of the page! Just click on the Route 66 picture and you will be on your way to wherever your travels take you.
